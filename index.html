        <h1>Thing's you can create with JavaScript</h1>
        <p>
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the technologies that power the web. You can start making amazing websites once
            you have these skills in your arsenal. The bare minimum is HTML and CSS, once you know these two languages
            you can start developing basic websites. JavaScript however opens up the door for more creative and
            intuitive solutions which take your website to the next level. <br><br>
            For example the game you may have played above was built using JavaScript. Using HTML Canvas and JavaScript
            you can build your 2d games. Once You've mastered JavaScript you can even build a 3d game using a library
            called ThreeJS. Don't worry about libraries for now, once you've got a hang of HTML, CSS and JavaScript look
            into JavaScript frameworks and libraries. <br><br>
            Below are some things you can create using JavaScript.</p>
        <div class="info-container">
            <div class="info-wrap">
                <div class="icon-container">
                    <img src="icons/web.svg">
                </div>
                <span>Websites</span>
                <p>Websites can be built using just HTML and CSS. JS allows you to add interactivity. Our navbar
                    changes transparency, this is done using JavaScript.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-wrap">
                <div class="icon-container">
                    <img src="icons/controller.svg">
                </div>
                <span>Games</span>
                <p>We built snake using JavaScript. You can make 2d and 3d games using JavaScript. There's a wide range
                    of YouTube tutorials that'll guide through the process.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-wrap">
                <div class="icon-container">
                    <img src="icons/phone.svg">
                </div>
                <span>Mobile Apps</span>
                <p>Mobile apps were traditionally built using Java, a different language to JS. In
                    recent years mobile apps have been built using React Native, a JS Framework.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-wrap">
                <div class="icon-container">
                    <img src="icons/web-app.svg">
                </div>
                <span>Web Apps</span>
                <p>You probably use browser based applications like Google Maps and Deliveroo throughout our day. Many
                    of these
                    apps are built using JavaScript.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-wrap">
                <div class="icon-container">
                    <img src="icons/paint.svg">
                </div>
                <span>Art</span>
                <p>HTML Canvas opened up the door for digital art to be created. We used it to create snake but it can
                    also be used to create digital art.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-wrap">
                <div class="icon-container">
                    <img src="icons/server.svg">
                </div>
                <span>Server Applications</span>
                <p>With the creation of Nodejs, JS could be run in the terminal/console. We can now build servers using
                    JS and ExpressJS, a JS framework, to make things easier</p>
