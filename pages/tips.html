            <h1>Tips for self-learning</h1>
            <p>Teaching yourself new concepts or how to code can be difficult when you have no mentor. It can get
                sometimes get overwhelming with there being numerous different ways to solve the same problem. We've
                compiled a some tips and information we think will be useful in order to assist you with teaching
                yourself. Throughout this page we'll cover the importance of responsibility, doing projects and doing
                research.</p>

        <h1>Responsibility</h1>
        <p>
            Personal responsibility is important when teaching yourself to code because it is up to you to take the
            necessary steps to learn and improve. This means setting aside time to study, staying organized, and seeking
            out resources and support when needed. It also means being disciplined and committed to your studies, and
            not letting distractions or other commitments get in the way of your learning. By taking personal
            responsibility for your learning, you can set yourself up for success and make the most of your time and
            efforts. Additionally, taking personal responsibility can help to build self-confidence and a sense of
            accomplishment as you progress in your coding skills.
        </p>
        <h2>Setting goals</h2>
        <p>
            Setting goals is important when teaching yourself coding because it helps to provide direction and focus. By
            setting specific goals, you can break down the learning process into manageable steps and track your
            progress along the way. This can help to motivate you to keep going and stay focused on your studies.
        </p>
        <h2>Deadlines</h2>
        <p>
            Deadlines are important when working on coding projects because they provide a sense of urgency and can help
            to ensure that you are making progress. By setting deadlines for yourself, you can create a sense of
            accountability and motivate yourself to work efficiently. This can help to prevent procrastination and
            ensure that you are making steady progress on your project.

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Making projects is an important part of the learning process for web development. It allows developers to
            apply what they have learned in a real-world context, and gain practical experience in building websites and
            web applications.
            <br><br>
            Working on projects can help developers learn how to design and implement different aspects of a web
            application, such as the user interface, the database, and the server-side logic. It can also help
            developers learn how to use different technologies and frameworks, and how to integrate them into a cohesive
            whole.

                    <p>A JavaScript calculator project is a fun and engaging way to learn and apply JavaScript
                        programming concepts. The project involves creating a simple calculator that can perform basic
                        mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. To complete
                        the project, you will need to use JavaScript to define functions for each operation and use HTML
                        and CSS to create the user interface.
